# Issue Resolution Summary
**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Issue:** ElevenLabs MCP Integration Failed  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Description

Your Square booking server was built with MCP protocol endpoints (`/mcp/list-tools` and `/mcp/call-tool`), but ElevenLabs "Server Tools" requires simpler REST API format with individual endpoints for each function.

**Error:** "MCP tool extraction failed" when trying to connect ElevenLabs to the server.

---

## Root Cause

**File:** `server.js`  
**Lines:** Original MCP endpoints (lines 27-156)

The server implemented the full Anthropic Model Context Protocol (MCP), which includes:
- SSE streaming
- Complex tool definition schema
- Unified call-tool endpoint

However, ElevenLabs "Server Tools" expects:
- Simple REST endpoints (POST to specific URLs)
- JSON request/response
- One endpoint per function

---

## Fix Applied

### Changes to `server.js`

**Added 5 new REST endpoints (lines 27-260):**
1. `POST /tools/getAvailability` - Check available time slots
2. `POST /tools/createBooking` - Create appointments
3. `POST /tools/rescheduleBooking` - Change appointment times
4. `POST /tools/cancelBooking` - Cancel appointments
5. `POST /tools/lookupBooking` - Find bookings by phone

**Each endpoint now:**
- Accepts direct JSON parameters (no wrapper)
- Returns standardized `{success: true/false, ...}` format
- Includes proper error handling with 400/500 status codes
- Validates required fields
- Maintains booking source tracking ("Phone Booking (ElevenLabs AI)")

**Kept legacy MCP endpoints** (lines 262-340) for backwards compatibility.

**Updated health endpoint** (lines 342-360) to show new endpoint structure.
