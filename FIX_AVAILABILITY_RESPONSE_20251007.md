# Fix: Smart Availability Response for ElevenLabs AI
**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Issue:** AI agent incorrectly reports times as unavailable when they are available

## Problem Identified

The `getAvailability` endpoint was returning 100+ time slots without checking if the exact requested time was available. This caused the ElevenLabs AI agent to:
1. Get overwhelmed by too much data
2. Fail to identify that the exact requested time WAS available
3. Suggest incorrect alternative times

### Example Issue:
- User requests: "tomorrow at noon with Soon for regular haircut"
- Square returns: 100+ slots INCLUDING the 12:00 PM slot
- AI responds: "Soon isn't available at 12:00 PM" ❌ (WRONG!)

## Solution Implemented

Updated `/tools/getAvailability` endpoint to:

### 1. Accept New Parameters
- `datetime` - The specific time being requested (instead of just `startDate`)
- `teamMemberId` - The specific team member (barber) being requested
- `serviceVariationId` - The service type

### 2. Smart Time Checking
When a specific `datetime` is provided:
- Search a ±2 hour window around the requested time
- Check if the EXACT requested time exists in available slots
- Return one of two clear responses:

**If Available:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "isAvailable": true,
  "requestedTimeFormatted": "12:00 PM",
  "message": "Yes, 12:00 PM is available",
  "slot": { ... }
}
```

**If Not Available:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "isAvailable": false,
  "closestAlternatives": [ ... 3-5 closest times ... ],
  "message": "That time is not available. The closest available times are: 11:45 AM, 12:15 PM, 12:30 PM"
}
```

### 3. Limited Results
When no specific time is requested:
- Only return first 10 slots (not 100+)
- Include a clear message with the first available time

## Benefits

✅ AI can now clearly see if requested time is available  
✅ Reduces data overwhelm (5 slots vs 100+ slots)  
✅ Clear boolean `isAvailable` flag  
✅ Human-readable messages for AI to use  
✅ Closest alternatives automatically calculated  

## Testing

Test with your n8n workflow:
```json
{
  "tool": "getAvailability",
  "datetime": "2025-10-08T12:00:00-04:00",
  "serviceVariationId": "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF",
  "teamMemberId": "TMKzhB-WjsDff5rr"
}
```

Expected: Clear response showing if 12:00 PM is available

## Deployment

Run: `./deploy.sh`

The changes are backward compatible - if no `datetime` is provided, it works like before.

## Files Changed

- `server.js` - Updated `/tools/getAvailability` endpoint (lines 127-248)
