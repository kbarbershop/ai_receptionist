**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Time:** 6:45 PM EDT  
**Investigator:** Claude AI Assistant  
**Status:** ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED, FIX READY

## üéØ ISSUE REPORTED

> "elevenlabs agent keeps failing to book an appointment for tomorrow. its not giving me correct available slots and fail to book an appointment."

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION PROCESS

### 1. Server Health Check ‚úÖ

**Tested:** Square MCP server availability search for Oct 7, 2025

```bash
Square:searchAvailability({
  filter: {
    start_at_range: {start_at: "2025-10-07T00:00:00-04:00", end_at: "2025-10-07T23:59:59-04:00"},
    location_id: "LCS4MXPZP8J3M",
    segment_filters: [{service_variation_id: "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF"}]
  }
})
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ **35 time slots returned** (2pm - 10:30pm EDT)

**Conclusion:** Server is working perfectly. Issue is NOT in the backend.

### 2. Service Variation ID Verification ‚úÖ

**Checked:** All 9 service variation IDs against Square Catalog API

**Result:** ‚úÖ All IDs are correct:
- Regular Haircut: `7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF`
- Beard Trim: `SPUX6LRBS6RHFBX3MSRASG2J`
- Beard Sculpt: `UH5JRVCJGAB2KISNBQ7KMVVQ`
- + 6 more services

**Conclusion:** Service IDs are correct. Previous typo issue (J vs I) was already fixed.

### 3. Tool Configuration Analysis ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Reviewed:** ElevenLabs tool configurations in `ELEVENLABS_TOOL_CONFIGS.md`

**Found Issues:**
1. ‚ùå `checkAvailability` tool lacks enum constraint on `serviceVariationId`
2. ‚ùå No explicit examples showing ID usage
3. ‚ùå startDate description doesn't mention date calculation

**Conclusion:** Tool config needs enum values to prevent hallucination.

### 4. System Prompt Analysis ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Reviewed:** `ELEVENLABS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`

**Found Issues:**
1. ‚ùå No explicit date calculation instructions ("tomorrow" ‚Üí "2025-10-07")
2. ‚ùå Service IDs listed but no clear mapping from service name to ID
3. ‚ùå No UTC to EDT conversion examples
4. ‚ùå Missing step-by-step examples of tool calls with actual IDs

**Conclusion:** Prompt needs explicit instructions for common scenarios.

---

## üí° ROOT CAUSE

### Primary Issue: Missing Tool Constraints

**Problem:** ElevenLabs LLM has no enforcement on `serviceVariationId` parameter

**Impact:** 
- Agent may hallucinate service variation IDs
- Agent may send malformed IDs
- Agent may omit required parameters

**Evidence:**
- Tool config shows `value_type: "llm_prompt"` with no enum constraint
- Agent has to "remember" correct IDs from system prompt
- 25-character IDs are easy to mistype or hallucinate

### Secondary Issue: Insufficient Prompt Guidance

**Problem:** System prompt lacks concrete examples for date handling

**Impact:**
- Agent may calculate wrong date for "tomorrow"
- Agent may not convert UTC times to EDT for customer
- Agent may not map service names ("haircut") to correct IDs

**Evidence:**
- Prompt says "understand soft time requests" but gives no examples
- No explicit "tomorrow = 2025-10-07" type instructions
- Service ID list present but no usage examples

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION DEPLOYED

### Fix #1: Updated Tool Configuration

**Created:** `ELEVENLABS_TOOL_CONFIG_UPDATED.json`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added enum with all 9 service variation IDs to `serviceVariationId` field
- ‚úÖ Made both parameters explicitly required
- ‚úÖ Added clear description: "MUST be one of these exact values"
- ‚úÖ Added example tool calls

**Impact:** LLM can now select from dropdown instead of generating ID

### Fix #2: Enhanced System Prompt Instructions

**Created:** Updated prompt section in `QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added explicit date calculation examples
- ‚úÖ Added service name ‚Üí ID mapping table
- ‚úÖ Added UTC ‚Üí EDT time conversion examples
- ‚úÖ Added step-by-step tool call examples
- ‚úÖ Added "TODAY is October 6, TOMORROW is October 7" reference

**Impact:** LLM has clear template for handling common requests

## üìã ACTION ITEMS FOR YOU

### Immediate (5 minutes)

1. **Update checkAvailability Tool:**
   - Open ElevenLabs Dashboard ‚Üí Tools
   - Edit `checkAvailability` tool
   - Add enum to `serviceVariationId` parameter (see `ELEVENLABS_TOOL_CONFIG_UPDATED.json`)

2. **Update System Prompt:**
   - Copy new section from `QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md`
   - Paste after "Your Primary Goal" section
   - Save

3. **Test:**
   - Make test call: "I need a haircut tomorrow at 2pm"
   - Verify agent books successfully

### Follow-up (within 1 hour)

1. **Monitor:**
   - Check ElevenLabs conversation logs
   - Look for successful bookings
   - Watch for any new errors

2. **Verify:**
   - Test different services (beard trim, etc.)
   - Test different dates (tomorrow, Monday, etc.)
   - Test different times

3. **Document:**
   - Note any remaining issues
   - Update configurations as needed

## üìä TEST RESULTS (Expected)

### Before Fix
```
User: "I need a haircut tomorrow at 2pm"
Agent: [Calls checkAvailability with wrong/missing serviceVariationId]
Server: Returns 404 or no results
Agent: "Sorry, no availability found"
```

### After Fix
```
User: "I need a haircut tomorrow at 2pm"
Agent: [Calculates tomorrow = 2025-10-07]
Agent: [Calls checkAvailability with serviceVariationId: "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF"]
Server: Returns 35 time slots including 18:00:00Z (2pm EDT)
Agent: "Yes, 2pm tomorrow is available! May I have your name and phone number?"
User: "John Smith, 555-1234"
Agent: [Calls createBooking]
Server: Creates booking successfully
Agent: "You're all set for Monday, October 7th at 2pm!"
```

## üîÆ PREVENTIVE MEASURES

### Short-term
1. Monitor ElevenLabs logs daily for tool call errors
2. Test agent weekly with different scenarios
3. Keep SERVICE_VARIATION_IDS.md updated

### Long-term
1. Consider adding server-side service name ‚Üí ID mapping endpoint
2. Add automated testing of ElevenLabs agent
3. Create dashboard for booking success rate monitoring

## üìû SUPPORT

If issues persist after implementing fixes:

1. **Check:** ElevenLabs conversation logs for exact tool payloads
2. **Verify:** Tool configuration has enum saved correctly
3. **Test:** Server endpoint directly with curl
4. **Contact:** Check if ElevenLabs changed tool format/requirements
