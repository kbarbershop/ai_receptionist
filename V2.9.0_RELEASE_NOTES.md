---

## üîß Technical Changes

### Backend Modifications

#### 1. Enhanced `createBooking()` Function
**File:** `src/services/bookingService.js`

**Changes:**
- Now accepts array of service IDs: `serviceVariationIds`
- Maintains backward compatibility with single `serviceVariationId`
- Calculates total duration across all services
- Creates single Square booking with multiple `appointmentSegments`
- Returns `duration_minutes` and `service_count` in response

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// OLD (still works)
await createBooking(customerId, startTime, "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF", teamId);

// NEW
await createBooking(customerId, startTime, [
  "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF",  // Haircut
  "SPUX6LRBS6RHFBX3MSRASG2J"   // Beard Trim
], teamId);
```

#### 2. Updated API Endpoint
**Endpoint:** `POST /createBooking`

**New Request Format:**
```json
{
  "customerName": "John Smith",
  "customerPhone": "5551234567",
  "startTime": "2025-10-15T14:00:00-04:00",
  "serviceVariationIds": [        // NEW: Array for multiple services
    "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF",
    "SPUX6LRBS6RHFBX3MSRASG2J"
  ]
}
```

**Enhanced Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "bookingId": "booking_abc123",
  "duration_minutes": 60,           // NEW
  "service_count": 2,               // NEW
  "services": [                     // NEW
    "Regular Haircut",
    "Beard Trim"
  ],
  "message": "Appointment created successfully for John Smith. Total duration: 60 minutes..."
}
```

#### 3. Duration Calculation
**How it works:**
```javascript
const SERVICE_DURATIONS = {
  '7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF': 1800000, // Haircut - 30 min
  'SPUX6LRBS6RHFBX3MSRASG2J': 1800000, // Beard Trim - 30 min
  'ALZZEN4DO6JCNMC6YPXN6DPH': 600000,  // Ear Waxing - 10 min
};

// Total duration = sum of all services
// Haircut (30) + Beard Trim (30) = 60 minutes
```

#### 4. Conflict Detection
System validates combined duration doesn't overlap with next appointment:

```javascript
// Allowed: Back-to-back appointments
2:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Customer A (Haircut + Beard Trim, 60 min)
3:00 PM - 3:30 PM: Customer B (Haircut, 30 min)

// Blocked: Overlapping appointments
2:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Customer A (Haircut + Beard Trim, 60 min)
2:45 PM - 3:15 PM: Customer B ‚Üê CONFLICT!
```

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### For Existing Integrations

**No Changes Required!**

Existing code continues to work:
```javascript
// This still works exactly as before
POST /createBooking
{
  "customerName": "John Smith",
  "customerPhone": "5551234567",
  "startTime": "2025-10-15T14:00:00-04:00",
  "serviceVariationId": "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF"  // ‚Üê Still valid

POST /createBooking
{
  "customerName": "John Smith",
  "customerPhone": "5551234567",
  "startTime": "2025-10-15T14:00:00-04:00",
  "serviceVariationIds": [                          // ‚Üê NEW
    "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF",
    "SPUX6LRBS6RHFBX3MSRASG2J"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Service Order:** Services are executed in order provided (no reordering)
2. **Same Barber:** All services in one appointment must be with same team member
3. **Duration Granularity:** Uses pre-defined service durations (no dynamic adjustment)
4. **Max Services:** No hard limit, but very long appointments may have availability issues

**None of these are blocking issues for v2.9.0 launch.**

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned for v2.10.0+

1. **Service Bundles**
   - Pre-configured service combinations
   - Bundle pricing (e.g., "Haircut + Beard Trim" package)

2. **Dynamic Duration**
   - Barber-specific service times
   - Experience-based duration adjustments

3. **Smart Suggestions**
   - AI suggests commonly paired services
   - "Customers who booked X also booked Y"

4. **Parallel Services**
   - Multiple barbers working simultaneously
   - More complex scheduling logic

5. **Break Time**
   - Buffer time between services within appointment
   - Setup/cleanup time calculation
