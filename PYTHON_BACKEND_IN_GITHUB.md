# 🎉 PYTHON BACKEND NOW IN GITHUB - COMPLETE!

## ✅ What Was Done (Oct 8, 2025)

The Python backend code has been successfully uploaded to the `kbarbershop/ai_receptionist` GitHub repository!

### 📦 Files Uploaded

All essential Python backend files are now in the `backend/` directory:

```
backend/
├── square_service.py      ✅ Fixed Square API integration
├── requirements.txt       ✅ Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile            ✅ Container configuration
├── cloudbuild.yaml       ✅ Google Cloud Build config
├── deploy_fix.sh         ✅ Deployment script
├── test_fix.sh           ✅ Testing script
├── .env.example          ✅ Environment template
├── .gitignore            ✅ Git ignore rules
└── README.md             ✅ Python backend docs
```

### 🔧 Square Customer API Fix Included

The critical fix for the Square Customer API error is already applied in `backend/square_service.py`:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT (lines 505-515)
customer_data = {
    'idempotency_key': str(uuid.uuid4()),
    'given_name': first_name,
    'family_name': last_name,
    'email_address': email,
    'phone_number': phone
}

create_response = self._make_request('POST', '/customers', customer_data)
```

**No more "unrecognized field 'customer'" errors!**

## 🗂️ Repository Organization

The repository now contains BOTH backend services:

### 📞 ElevenLabs AI (Node.js) - Root Directory
```
ai_receptionist/
├── server.js              # ElevenLabs tools server
├── package.json
├── Dockerfile
└── deploy.sh
```

### 🐍 Website Backend (Python) - backend/ Directory
```
ai_receptionist/
└── backend/
    ├── square_service.py  # Square API (FIXED ✅)
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── deploy_fix.sh
```

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Deploy Python Backend from GitHub

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kbarbershop/ai_receptionist.git
cd ai_receptionist/backend

# Deploy to Cloud Run
chmod +x deploy_fix.sh
./deploy_fix.sh
```

### Deploy ElevenLabs AI from GitHub

```bash
# From repository root
cd ai_receptionist
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## 🔄 Workflow Going Forward

### Making Changes to Python Backend

1. **Edit locally:**
   ```bash
   cd /Volumes/T7/Barber/website-code/github/website/backend
   # Make your changes to square_service.py or other files
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ai_receptionist
   cp /Volumes/T7/Barber/website-code/github/website/backend/square_service.py backend/
   git add backend/
   git commit -m "Update Python backend"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy from GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./deploy_fix.sh
   ```

### Keeping Both Locations in Sync

You can continue working in `/Volumes/T7/Barber/website-code/github/website/backend` and just copy the updated files to the GitHub repo when ready to commit.
