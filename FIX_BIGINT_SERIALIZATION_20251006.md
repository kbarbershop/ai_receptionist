# Fix Summary: BigInt Serialization Error in getAvailability

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Issue:** `getAvailability` tool failing with BigInt serialization error  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem

When ElevenLabs called the `getAvailability` endpoint, it returned:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Do not know how to serialize a BigInt"
}
```

This prevented the AI from finding available appointment slots, causing it to:
- Tell customers "the system is down"
- Offer to "book them later when the system is back up" (NOT ALLOWED)
- Fail to complete bookings

### Root Cause

Square API returns objects containing BigInt values (large integers) which **cannot be serialized to JSON** by Node.js default `JSON.stringify()`.

**Problem locations:**
- Line 99: `availableSlots: response.result.availabilities` - Contains BigInt
- Line 215: `booking: bookingResponse.result.booking` - Contains BigInt  
- Line 273: `booking: updateResponse.result.booking` - Contains BigInt
- Line 320: `booking: cancelResponse.result.booking` - Contains BigInt
- Line 369-370: Customer and bookings data - Contains BigInt

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created BigInt Sanitization Function

**Added lines 34-54:**
```javascript
const sanitizeBigInt = (obj) => {
  if (obj === null || obj === undefined) return obj;
  if (typeof obj === 'bigint') return obj.toString();
  if (typeof obj !== 'object') return obj;
  
  if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
    return obj.map(item => sanitizeBigInt(item));
  }
  
  const sanitized = {};
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
    if (typeof value === 'bigint') {
      sanitized[key] = value.toString();
    } else if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {
      sanitized[key] = sanitizeBigInt(value);
    } else {
      sanitized[key] = value;
    }
  }
  return sanitized;
};
```

This function:
- Recursively walks through objects/arrays
- Converts all BigInt values to strings
- Preserves all other data types
- Handles nested structures

### 2. Applied Sanitization to All API Responses

**getAvailability (Line 123):**
```javascript
const availabilities = sanitizeBigInt(response.result.availabilities || []);
res.json({
  success: true,
  availableSlots: availabilities,  // Now JSON-safe
  ...
});
```

**createBooking (Line 211):**
```javascript
const booking = sanitizeBigInt(bookingResponse.result.booking);
res.json({
  success: true,
  booking: booking,  // Now JSON-safe
  ...
});
```

**rescheduleBooking (Line 276):**
```javascript
const booking = sanitizeBigInt(updateResponse.result.booking);
```

**cancelBooking (Line 320):**
```javascript
const booking = sanitizeBigInt(cancelResponse.result.booking);
```

**lookupBooking (Lines 369-370):**
```javascript
const customer = sanitizeBigInt(searchResponse.result.customers[0]);
const bookings = sanitizeBigInt(bookingsResponse.result.bookings || []);
```

## Testing

### Test 1: getAvailability
```bash
curl -X POST https://square-mcp-server-265357944939.us-east4.run.app/tools/getAvailability \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "startDate": "2025-10-07",
    "serviceVariationId": "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF"
  }'
```
**Expected:** ✅ Returns array of available time slots (no BigInt error)

### Test 2: createBooking
```bash
curl -X POST https://square-mcp-server-265357944939.us-east4.run.app/tools/createBooking \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerName": "John Doe",
    "customerPhone": "5555551234",
    "startTime": "2025-10-08T14:00:00Z",
    "serviceVariationId": "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF",
    "teamMemberId": "TMKzhB-WjsDff5rr"
  }'
```
**Expected:** ✅ Returns booking confirmation (no BigInt error)

### Test 3: ElevenLabs Call
1. Call the ElevenLabs number
2. Say: "I'd like to book a haircut for tomorrow at 2pm"
3. AI should:
   - ✅ Check availability using getAvailability
   - ✅ Show available times if 2pm is taken
   - ❌ NEVER say "system is down" or "I'll book you later"

---

## Deployment

```bash
# Redeploy to Google Cloud Run
cd ~/path/to/ai_receptionist
git pull
./deploy.sh
```

**OR** use Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to Cloud Run → square-mcp-server
2. Click "Edit & Deploy New Revision"
3. Keep settings, click "Deploy"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Verify Deployment

```bash
curl https://square-mcp-server-265357944939.us-east4.run.app/health
```
Should show: `"version": "2.2.4 - BigInt Serialization Fix"`

## System Prompt Behavior

**The system prompt already has correct rules** (no changes needed):

```
**Rules:**
- **NEVER offer to put customer on a waitlist** - only book confirmed appointments
- **NEVER offer to call back when a spot opens** - we don't offer this service
- **NEVER offer to hold a spot temporarily** - customers must book immediately or choose another time
```

If AI still says "book later when system is back up", it means:
1. **Server is still on old version** - redeploy
2. **AI is not following system prompt** - reinforce in ElevenLabs settings
3. **Availability really is failing** - check Cloud Run logs

---

## What Was Happening

**Before Fix:**
1. Customer: "Can I book a haircut tomorrow at 2pm?"
2. AI calls `getAvailability` → **500 Error: BigInt serialization**
3. AI thinks: "System is broken"
4. AI says: "Our booking system is temporarily down. Would you like me to book you later when it's back up?"

**After Fix:**
1. Customer: "Can I book a haircut tomorrow at 2pm?"
2. AI calls `getAvailability` → **✅ Returns available slots**
3. AI says: "I don't have 2pm available, but I have 3pm, 4pm, or 5pm. Would any of those work?"

---

## Prevention

For future Square API integrations:
1. ✅ Always sanitize Square API responses with `sanitizeBigInt()`
2. ✅ Test JSON serialization before deploying
3. ✅ Square uses BigInt for version numbers, timestamps, and amounts
4. ✅ Node.js cannot serialize BigInt to JSON by default
