# Action Required: Fix ElevenLabs Agent Configuration

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Priority:** 🚨 CRITICAL  
**Status:** Ready to Fix

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

Your ElevenLabs AI receptionist is **failing to book appointments** due to incorrect service variation IDs in the agent configuration. The Square server is working perfectly - the agent just needs updated configuration.

**Impact:** Every customer calling to book an appointment gets an error message.

**Fix Time:** ~15 minutes

---

## 🔴 Current State (BROKEN)

**Symptom:** Agent says "I'm seeing an error checking availability right now"

**Root Cause:** Single-character typo in service variation ID
- Using: `7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMJABKF` (**J** at position 19)
- Should be: `7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF` (**I** at position 19)

**Evidence:** Conversation logs show repeated failures on availability checks

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed (GitHub)

## 🔧 What YOU Need to Do (ElevenLabs Dashboard)

### Step 1: Update System Prompt (5 minutes)

1. Go to: https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai
2. Select agent: "kbarbershop ai agent with square"
3. Click **Agent** tab
4. Replace **System Prompt** with content from:
   ```
   https://github.com/kbarbershop/ai_receptionist/blob/main/ELEVENLABS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md
   ```
5. Click **Save**

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Added all 9 service variation IDs
- ✅ Added team member IDs
- ✅ Removed all waitlist/callback/hold language
- ✅ Added explicit "NO WAITLISTS" rules

---

### Step 2: Update Tool Configurations (10 minutes)

Go to **Tools** tab and update these tools:

#### Tool: checkAvailability (or getAvailability)

**Find this example in the tool config and update the ID:**

❌ **OLD (Broken):**
```json
{
  "serviceVariationId": "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMJABKF"
}
```

✅ **NEW (Fixed):**
```json
{
  "serviceVariationId": "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF"
}
```

**Note the character at position 19:** J → I

---

#### Tool: createBooking

Update any example requests to use correct IDs:

```json
{
  "serviceVariationId": "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF",
  "teamMemberId": "TMeze5z5YYPIgXCe"
}
```

---

### Step 3: Test the Agent (5 minutes)

**Make a test call and say:**
> "I'd like to book a haircut for tomorrow at 2pm"

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Agent checks availability successfully (no errors!)
- ✅ Agent asks for name and phone number
- ✅ Agent creates booking
- ✅ Booking appears in Square Dashboard

**If you still get errors:**
- Double-check the service variation ID has **I** not **J**
- Verify you saved the changes
- Check the detailed testing guide: `ELEVENLABS_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
