## üéØ THE PROBLEM

Your ElevenLabs AI agent is failing to:
1. Return correct available appointment slots for tomorrow
2. Successfully book appointments

---

## ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE (CONFIRMED)

After thorough investigation using Square MCP:

1. **Server is working perfectly** ‚úÖ
   - Tested availability for tomorrow Oct 7
   - Returns 35+ time slots correctly
   - All 9 services configured properly

2. **Service IDs are correct** ‚úÖ
   - All variation IDs verified
   - No typos (previous J/I typo was already fixed)

3. **The issue is in ElevenLabs configuration** ‚ùå
   - Tool may not have required field constraints
   - Agent may not be using correct service variation IDs
   - Date/time conversion may be failing

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE FIX (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Update checkAvailability Tool in ElevenLabs

1. Go to ElevenLabs Dashboard ‚Üí Your Agent ‚Üí Tools
2. Find **checkAvailability** tool
3. Edit the tool configuration
4. **CRITICAL:** Add enum constraint to serviceVariationId parameter

**Updated serviceVariationId field:**

```json
{
  "id": "serviceVariationId",
  "type": "string",
  "description": "Service variation ID. MUST be one of the exact values from enum list. For haircut use 7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF. Copy exactly, do not type manually.",
  "required": true,
  "value_type": "llm_prompt",
  "enum": [
    "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF",
    "SPUX6LRBS6RHFBX3MSRASG2J",
    "UH5JRVCJGAB2KISNBQ7KMVVQ",
    "ALZZEN4DO6JCNMC6YPXN6DPH",
    "VVGK7I7L6BHTG7LFKLAIRHBZ",
    "3TV5CVRXCB62BWIWVY6OCXIC",
    "7ND6OIFTRLJEPMDBBI3B3ELT",
    "7UKWUIF4CP7YR27FI52DWPEN",
    "7PFUQVFMALHIPDAJSYCBKBYV"
  ]
}
```

**Updated startDate field:**

```json
{
  "id": "startDate",
  "type": "string",
  "description": "Date in YYYY-MM-DD format. TODAY is 2025-10-06. When customer says 'tomorrow', use '2025-10-07'. When they say 'next Monday', calculate the date.",
  "required": true,
  "value_type": "llm_prompt"
}
```

5. Save the tool

### Step 2: Update System Prompt

Add this section right after "Your Primary Goal" section:

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Date & Service ID Handling

### When Customer Asks for Availability

**Customer says: "Can I get a haircut tomorrow?"**

YOU MUST:
1. Identify service: "haircut" = use service ID `7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF`
2. Calculate date: Tomorrow = October 7, 2025 = `2025-10-07`
3. Call checkAvailability tool with:
   ```json
   {
     "startDate": "2025-10-07",
     "serviceVariationId": "7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF"
   }
   ```

**Customer says: "What's available for a beard trim on Monday?"**

YOU MUST:
1. Identify service: "beard trim" = use service ID `SPUX6LRBS6RHFBX3MSRASG2J`
2. Calculate date: Next Monday = October 14, 2025 = `2025-10-14`
3. Call checkAvailability tool with:
   ```json
   {
     "startDate": "2025-10-14",
     "serviceVariationId": "SPUX6LRBS6RHFBX3MSRASG2J"
   }
   ```

### Service Name to ID Mapping (MEMORIZE THIS)

- "haircut" ‚Üí `7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF`
- "beard trim" ‚Üí `SPUX6LRBS6RHFBX3MSRASG2J`
- "beard sculpt" ‚Üí `UH5JRVCJGAB2KISNBQ7KMVVQ`
- "ear wax" or "ear waxing" ‚Üí `ALZZEN4DO6JCNMC6YPXN6DPH`
- "nose wax" or "nose waxing" ‚Üí `VVGK7I7L6BHTG7LFKLAIRHBZ`
- "eyebrow wax" or "eyebrow waxing" ‚Üí `3TV5CVRXCB62BWIWVY6OCXIC`
- "paraffin" ‚Üí `7ND6OIFTRLJEPMDBBI3B3ELT`
- "gold package" ‚Üí `7UKWUIF4CP7YR27FI52DWPEN`
- "silver package" ‚Üí `7PFUQVFMALHIPDAJSYCBKBYV`

### Today's Date Reference
- **TODAY:** October 6, 2025 (Sunday)
- **TOMORROW:** October 7, 2025 (Monday)
- **TIMEZONE:** America/New_York (EDT, UTC-4)

### Converting Tool Response Times

When tool returns times like `"start_at": "2025-10-07T18:00:00Z"`:
- This is **6:00 PM UTC**
- Convert to EDT: 6:00 PM UTC = **2:00 PM EDT**
- Tell customer: "I have 2pm available"

### CRITICAL RULES
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS call checkAvailability before offering times
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS use exact service variation ID from list above
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS calculate correct date when customer says "tomorrow"
- ‚ùå NEVER guess availability times
- ‚ùå NEVER use wrong service variation ID
- ‚ùå NEVER forget to convert UTC times to EDT for customer
```

### Step 3: Test Immediately

**Test Call Script:**

```
"Hi, I'd like to book a haircut for tomorrow at 2pm"

Expected Agent Behavior:
1. Agent calculates tomorrow = 2025-10-07
2. Agent calls checkAvailability with serviceVariationId: 7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF
3. Agent sees 18:00:00Z in response (which is 2pm EDT)
4. Agent says: "Yes, I have 2pm available tomorrow. May I have your name and phone number?"
5. Agent proceeds to book
```

---

## üìä VERIFICATION

### Test These Scenarios

1. **Tomorrow at specific time:**
   ```
   Customer: "Can I get a haircut tomorrow at 2pm?"
   Expected: Agent finds and books 2pm slot
   ```

2. **Tomorrow without time:**
   ```
   Customer: "What times are available tomorrow for a haircut?"
   Expected: Agent lists available times in EDT (e.g., "10am, 11am, 2pm...")
   ```

3. **Different service:**
   ```
   Customer: "I need a beard trim on Monday"
   Expected: Agent uses correct service ID for beard trim
   ```

## üêõ IF STILL FAILING

### Check ElevenLabs Conversation Logs

1. Go to ElevenLabs Dashboard ‚Üí Conversation History
2. Find recent failed booking attempt
3. Look at tool calls section
4. Check what was sent to `checkAvailability`

**Look for:**
- Is `serviceVariationId` included? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Is it one of the 9 correct IDs? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Is `startDate` in YYYY-MM-DD format? ‚úÖ/‚ùå
- Is the date correct (tomorrow = 2025-10-07)? ‚úÖ/‚ùå

### Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| No serviceVariationId sent | Tool config missing enum | Add enum to tool configuration |
| Wrong serviceVariationId | Agent hallucinating ID | Add ID mapping to system prompt |
| Wrong date format | Agent not calculating correctly | Add explicit date examples to prompt |
| No availability returned | startDate is today instead of tomorrow | Fix date calculation in prompt |

## üìû TEST NOW

**Make a test call right now:**

1. Call the ElevenLabs agent
2. Say: "I'd like to book a haircut tomorrow at 2pm"
3. Observe what happens

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Agent says "Let me check availability"
- ‚úÖ Agent confirms "2pm tomorrow is available"
- ‚úÖ Agent asks for name and phone
- ‚úÖ Agent books successfully

**If ANY step fails:**
1. Check ElevenLabs conversation logs
2. Look at exact tool call payload
3. Compare against correct format above
4. Update tool config or prompt as needed

---

## üìù SUMMARY

**What was wrong:**
- ElevenLabs tool configuration likely missing enum constraint for serviceVariationId
- System prompt needs explicit date handling examples
- Agent needs service name ‚Üí ID mapping reference

**What we fixed:**
- ‚úÖ Added enum to serviceVariationId parameter
- ‚úÖ Added date calculation examples
- ‚úÖ Added service name to ID mapping
- ‚úÖ Added UTC to EDT conversion instructions

**Next steps:**
1. Update tool config (2 min)
2. Update system prompt (3 min)
3. Test with real call (2 min)
4. Monitor over next hour
