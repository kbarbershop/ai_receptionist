## How generalInquiry Works

### Smart Auto-Detection
The LLM can optionally specify `inquiryType`, but if left empty, the tool returns **all information**:
- Business hours & location
- Services & pricing
- Team members

### Inquiry Type Options

| inquiryType Value | Returns | Use When Customer Asks |
|-------------------|---------|----------------------|
| `"hours"` or `"location"` | Business hours, timezone, address, phone | "What time do you close?", "Where are you located?" |
| `"services"` or `"pricing"` | All services with prices and durations | "How much is a haircut?", "What services do you offer?" |
| `"staff"` or `"barbers"` or `"team"` | List of all barbers/team members | "Who works there?", "Can I book with John?" |
| Empty (no parameter) | Everything above | Any general question |

### Example Responses

**Customer asks: "What time do you close?"**
- Agent calls: `generalInquiry` with `inquiryType: "hours"`
- Returns: Business hours, address, phone

**Customer asks: "How much is a haircut?"**
- Agent calls: `generalInquiry` with `inquiryType: "services"`
- Returns: All services with pricing

**Customer asks: "Tell me about your shop"**
- Agent calls: `generalInquiry` with no parameters
- Returns: Hours + Services + Staff (everything)

## Tool Usage Examples

### Using generalInquiry

**Example 1: Hours question**
```
Customer: "What time do you close today?"
Agent: [Calls generalInquiry with inquiryType: "hours"]
Response: { businessHours: {...}, timezone: "America/New_York", address: {...} }
Agent: "We're open until 7pm today!"
```

**Example 2: Pricing question**
```
Customer: "How much is a haircut?"
Agent: [Calls generalInquiry with inquiryType: "services"]
Response: { services: [{name: "Men's Haircut", price: "30.00", ...}] }
Agent: "Our men's haircut is $30 and takes about 30 minutes."
```

**Example 3: Staff question**
```
Customer: "Can I book with John?"
Agent: [Calls generalInquiry with inquiryType: "staff"]
Response: { teamMembers: [{fullName: "John Smith", ...}] }
Agent: "Yes, John is available! What day works for you?"
```

**Example 4: General question**
```
Customer: "Tell me about your barbershop"
Agent: [Calls generalInquiry with no parameters]
Response: { businessHours: {...}, services: [...], teamMembers: [...] }
Agent: "We're located in Great Falls Plaza, open Tue-Sat 10am-7pm. We offer haircuts, beard trims, and styling services. Our team includes John, Mike, and Sarah."
```

## Troubleshooting

**Tool not being called:**
- Check tool name is exactly "generalInquiry"
- Verify description mentions hours, services, AND staff
- Update system prompt to reference this unified tool

**Tool returns partial data:**
- Normal! It only returns what Square has configured
- Check Square Dashboard for missing data (services, team members, hours)

**inquiryType not working:**
- Make it optional - agent can call without it
- Tool works fine with no parameters (returns everything)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy server:** `cd ~/square-mcp-server-deploy && git pull && ./deploy.sh`
2. **Add only 6 tools** to ElevenLabs (not 8)
3. **Update system prompt** to reference generalInquiry
4. **Test:** Ask about hours, pricing, and staff

**Much simpler than 3 separate tools! üéâ**
