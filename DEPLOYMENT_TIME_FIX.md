# DEPLOYMENT: Human-Readable Time Fix

**Date:** October 6, 2025 8:00 PM EDT  
**Version:** 2.3.0  
**Issue:** ElevenLabs agent showing wrong availability times (2pm instead of 10am)

---

## Problem Identified

**Root Cause:** Server returns times in UTC format (`14:00:00Z`), but ElevenLabs agent interprets them as local EDT times.

**Example:**
- Server returns: `2025-10-07T14:00:00Z` (10am EDT in UTC)
- Agent sees: "14:00" and says "2pm" ❌
- Should say: "10am" ✅

---

## Solution Applied

### Updated `server.js`:

1. **Added `formatTimeSlot()` helper function**
   - Converts UTC times to EDT
   - Adds human-readable format: "10:00 AM", "2:30 PM", etc.
   - Keeps both UTC and EDT timestamps

2. **Enhanced `/tools/getAvailability` response**
   ```javascript
   {
     start_at_utc: "2025-10-07T14:00:00Z",
     start_at_edt: "2025-10-07T10:00:00-04:00",
     human_readable: "10:00 AM",  // ← Agent uses this
     time_24h: "10:00"
   }
   ```

3. **Added logging** to track what's being sent/received

4. **Updated `/tools/createBooking`**
   - Now handles human-readable time objects
   - Defaults to `TMKzhB-WjsDff5rr` if no team member specified
   - Better error messages

## Deployment Steps

```bash
cd /Users/byungchanlim/square-mcp-server-deploy
./deploy.sh
```

**Estimated time:** 3-5 minutes

---

## Expected Result

**After deployment:**

```
Customer: "Book me tomorrow at 10am"
Agent calls: checkAvailability
Server returns: { human_readable: "10:00 AM", ... }
Agent says: "Yes, 10am is available" ✅

Customer: "What times are open?"
Server returns: All slots from 10:00 AM to 10:30 PM
Agent says: "We have 10am, 10:15am, 10:30am..." ✅
```

---

## Verification

After deployment:

1. **Test availability:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://square-mcp-server-265357944939.us-east4.run.app/tools/getAvailability \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"startDate":"2025-10-07","serviceVariationId":"7XPUHGDLY4N3H2OWTHMIABKF"}'
   ```

2. **Check response format:**
   - Should include `human_readable` field
   - Should show "10:00 AM" not "14:00"

3. **Test with ElevenLabs:**
   - Call agent: "What times are available tomorrow?"
   - Should list: "10am, 10:15am, 10:30am..." etc.
