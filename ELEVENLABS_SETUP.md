## üéØ Step 3: Update Agent System Prompt

Add this to your agent's system prompt to guide tool usage:

```
You are the AI receptionist for K Barbershop. You can help customers book, reschedule, and cancel appointments.

TOOL USAGE WORKFLOW:

For NEW bookings:
1. Greet the customer warmly
2. Use checkAvailability to show available time slots
3. Collect: customer name, phone number, email (optional), preferred time
4. Confirm all details with customer
5. Use createBooking to book the appointment
6. Provide confirmation with appointment details

For RESCHEDULING:
1. Get customer's phone number
2. Use lookupBooking to find their appointment
3. Show current appointment details
4. Use checkAvailability to show new available times
5. Get customer's preferred new time
6. Confirm change with customer
7. Use rescheduleBooking with the booking ID

For CANCELLATIONS:
1. Get customer's phone number
2. Use lookupBooking to find their appointment
3. Show appointment details
4. Ask customer to confirm they want to cancel
5. Use cancelBooking with the booking ID
6. Confirm cancellation

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Always confirm details before creating/changing appointments
- Be friendly and professional
- If lookup returns multiple bookings, ask which one they're calling about
- Always read back appointment details for confirmation
- Convert times to customer's local timezone (EST for K Barbershop)
```

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Test Your Integration

### Test in ElevenLabs Dashboard:

1. **Test Availability:**
   - Ask: "What time slots do you have available this week?"
   - Agent should call `checkAvailability` and show results

2. **Test Booking:**
   - Say: "I'd like to book a haircut for tomorrow at 2pm. My name is John Smith and my phone is 555-0123"
   - Agent should use `createBooking`

3. **Test Lookup:**
   - Say: "I need to check my appointment. My phone is 555-0123"
   - Agent should use `lookupBooking`

4. **Test Reschedule:**
   - Say: "Can I move my appointment to a different day?"
   - Agent should lookup ‚Üí show availability ‚Üí reschedule

5. **Test Cancel:**
   - Say: "I need to cancel my appointment"
   - Agent should lookup ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí cancel

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Check Server Health:
```bash
curl https://square-mcp-server-265357944939.us-east4.run.app/health
```

### View Booking Sources (Last 30 Days):
```bash
curl https://square-mcp-server-265357944939.us-east4.run.app/analytics/sources
```

This shows how many bookings came from:
- Phone (ElevenLabs AI)
- Website
- In-store
- Manual

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Tool Not Being Called:
- Check tool name and description are clear
- Update system prompt with more specific instructions
- Test with simpler queries first

### Authentication Errors:
- Verify Cloud Run deployment succeeded
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Test endpoint directly with curl

### Booking Fails:
- Check Square API credentials are valid
- Verify Location ID matches your Square location
- Look at Cloud Run logs: `gcloud run logs read square-mcp-server --region us-east4`

---

## üìù Next Steps

1. Deploy updated server to Cloud Run
2. Configure all 5 tools in ElevenLabs
3. Update agent system prompt
4. Test each workflow thoroughly
5. Monitor analytics endpoint to track phone vs website bookings

**All phone bookings will be tagged as "Phone Booking (ElevenLabs AI)" in Square's customer notes for tracking!**
